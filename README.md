# Titanic-Kaggle

From the famous [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset, we are trying to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.

I, Patrick Vieira, will learn more and more about Data Science while trying to solve this problem.

As I am an aspiring Data Scientist/Engineer, I am trying to learn more and more about Data Science and this problem can help me learn and study.

Currently learning from courses and trying to apply every knowledge to this problem I am currently solving.

# Finally submitted my first notebook to Kaggle Competition (20th of June, 2022)

So after practing on the famous Titanic dataset while learning from courses I was able to submit it.

It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it. Here are the main points learned throughout the process:

    - As soon as you have your dataset, start cleaning the data and transforming it into a format that is easy to work with.
    - Remember to treat all missing data and remove all the data that is not relevant to the problem.
    - Use OneHotEncoder to transform categorical data into numerical data.
    - Use LabelEncoder to transform categorical data into numerical data, but only when there is a ordinal relationship among the data.
    - Standartization is separated between train and test data, because you can easily overfit doing so. This is a good practice to avoid overfitting.
    - Rank all models used using a score to evaluate them.
    - Don't forget to apply all the changes that you did on the training data to the test data.

So what's next to me?

Now, I am going to learn more profund topics about Machine Learning (I am eager to start learning about Deep Learning and how to use it to solve this problem).

In the future, as soon as I learned more about Deep Learning, I will try to solve this problem using a Neural Network and see how it differs from my first Machine Learning algorithm.

For now, I am quite proud of all the lessons I've learned through this problem and I am looking forward to learn more about Machine Learning and Data Science.
